    "### Pandas Lesson 1: Series\n",
    "This tutorial introduces the fundamental building block of pandas: Series. By the end of this section, you will learn how to create different types of Series, subset them, modify them, and summarize them.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What is a Series?\n",
    "In the simpliest terms, a Series is an ordered collection of values, generally all of the same type. For example, you can have a Series that contains the ages of everyone in your class (a numeric Series), or a Series of all the names of people in your family (a string Series).\n",
    "\n",
    "This may sound familiar: isn’t that how we described numpy vectors (i.e. one-dimensional numpy arrays)? Yes! In fact, Series are basically one-dimensional numpy arrays with lots of extra features added on top of them. As we’ll see, most everything you could do with a numpy array you can do with a Series; Series can just do more.\n",
    "\n",
    "Series are central to pandas because pandas was designed for statistics, and Series are a perfect way to collect lots of different observations of a variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are lots of ways to create Series, but the easiest is to just pass a list or an array to the pd.Series constructor.\n",
    "\n",
    "To illustrate, let me tell you about a week at the zoo I wish I owned. Here’s what attendance looked like at my zoo last week:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Day of Week | Attendees   |\n",
    "|   :----     |    ----:    |   \n",
    "| Monday      | 132 people  | \n",
    "| Tuesday     | 94 people   | \n",

    "2. Subsetting Series\n",
    "Extracting a subset of elements from a Series is an extremely important task, not least because it generalizes nicely to working with bigger datasets (which are at the heart of data science). This process — whether applied to a Series or a dataset — is often referred to as “taking a subset”, “subsetting”, or “filtering”. If there is one skill you need to master as quickly as possible, it’s this.\n",
    "\n",
    "In pandas, there are three ways to filter a Series: using a separate logical Series, using row-number indexing, and using index labels. I tend to use the first method most, but all three are useful. The first and second of these you will recognize from numpy arrays, while the last once (since it uses index labels which only exist in pandas) is unique to pandas.\n",
    "\n",
    "Subsetting using row-number indexing\n",
    "A different way to subset a Series is to specify the row-numbers you want to keep using the iloc function. (iloc stands for “integer location”, since row numbers are always integers). This will give you the behavior you’re more familiar with from R or numpy. Just remember that, as in all of Python, the first row is numbered 0!"
